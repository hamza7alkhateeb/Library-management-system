# Library-management-system

A website library project programmed using Django, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL, a user is welcomed with  two charts, one demonstrates the percentage of the books sold, rented and ones that are available, while the other chart shows the total profit split into two columns, one presents profits for rented books and the other for sold books.
Below these charts, the user will see a list of books with certain details like their name as well as the author's name, price, state (if sold, rented or available) and how many pages the book has, he/she can use the category section to show specific books under the desired genre, or enlist (or edit) book(s) of their own on the website and fill in the required information and under which category the book is in.
